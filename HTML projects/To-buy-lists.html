                    <td>It has the Razer opto-mechanical switches,which lasts for 100 million keystrokes.</td>
                    <td>They are linear switches,it's like the Cherry MX speed I have already had on my K70 rapidfire.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>RGB lighting,controlable by the Razer Synapse program.</td>

                    <td>Has RGB lighting.</td>
                    <td>Quite hard to change lighting modes since it uses the Function key and stuff to change between the modes so I shouldn't lose the user manual.</td>

                <td>It has Cherry MX switches,again you can choose between blue,red and brown but the switches on this keyboard have the HOT swappable feature.So you can swap out and chang the switches when one broke down or just how ever you like.</td>
                <td>It uses a Micro USB port instead,like what the flying fuck.Micro USB in 2020???</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>It has RGB lighting,controllable by the G Hub program,and it has the 2 "Pro" written on 2 sides of the keyboard(lol)</td>
                <td>Well you have to download the G Hub program and run it when you use the keyboard to gain access to all the features.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h3>In conclusion,I might have to choose the Keychron K2.Since it has the Mac layout and it also the cheapest of them all,which is really crazy since it have absolute no problem,no cons.I put the fact that it has Gateron switches in the Cons section because I don't know the feeling to type on Gateron switches.</h3>

                <td>I'm not sure why but the Sony app requires pictures of your ears to analize something,which is quite weird to me and the set up process sucks.(Not the actual set up for the MF-1000XM3 tho,it was for 360 sound or something).</td>

        <p>After the day 13rd Jan,2020.I've bought the Apple Airpods Pro,the Ducky One 2 SF and a random wireless charger,because the 2 in 1 wireless charger was out of stock so I have to go with the normal wireless charger that didn't come with a dock with an USB port</p> </main>
