                    <td>They are linear switches,it's like the Cherry MX speed I have already had on my K70 rapidfire.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>RGB lighting,controlable by the Razer Synapse program.</td>

                <td>It has Cherry MX switches,again you can choose between blue,red and brown but the switches on this keyboard have the HOT swappable feature.So you can swap out and chang the switches when one broke down or just how ever you like.</td>
                <td>It uses a Micro USB port instead,like what the flying fuck.Micro USB in 2020???</td>

                <td>It has RGB lighting,controllable by the G Hub program,and it has the 2 "Pro" written on 2 sides of the keyboard(lol)</td>
                <td>Well you have to download the G Hub program and run it when you use the keyboard to gain access to all the features.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h3>In conclusion,I might have to choose the Keychron K2.Since it has the Mac layout and it also the cheapest of them all,which is really crazy since it have absolute no problem,no cons.I put the fact that it has Gateron switches in the Cons section because I don't know the feeling to type on Gateron switches.</h3>

        <h1>The amount of money I will spend:</h1>
        <p>For the Apple AirPods Pro:6990000+Ducky One 2 SF RGB:2031000+Basues wireless charger:300000+Baseus 2 in 1,type C to type C and lighting:200000</p>
        <p>After the day 13rd Jan,2020.I've bought the Apple Airpods Pro,the Ducky One 2 SF and a random wireless charger,because the 2 in 1 wireless charger was out of stock so I have to go with the normal wireless charger that didn't come with a dock with an USB port</p>
        <h1>Now to the fragrance,I want to smell good,don't I?</h1>
        <p>First of all,I have something in my mind and I'm gonna make a list of fragrance down bellow.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dior Sauvage Eau De Toilette</li>
            <li>Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gio Profumo Parfurm</li>
            <li>Yves Saint Laurent La Nuit L'Homme Eau De Toilette</li>
            <li>Tom Ford Noir Extreme Eau De Parfum</li>
            <li>Prada L'Homme Eau De Toilette</li>
            <li>Chanel Bleu De Chanel Eau De Parfum/Eau De Toilette</li>
            <li>Bvlgari Aqva Amara Eau De Toilette</li>
            <li>Dolce&Gabbana The One Eau De Parfum</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm not rich enough to afford every 100ml bottles of those fragrance I listed above.So I decided to buy some mini bottles and vial from an online shopping website that takes 2 million years to deliver the product from the seller to me,a normal buyer who paid extra to get the product delivered to my door.</p>
        <p>I should have bought vials instead since it's the first time I buy fragrance and I should try wearing them on myself first but I'm pretty confident with Dior Sauvage and Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gio.</p>
        <p>So I went ahead and ordered 2 mini bottles(10ml bottle)of both.Since I haven't make any money by my own,I say this because spend an entire month just to get about $100 is nothing.Yup,that was my last work salary.</p>
        <h1>Bad news incoming,I bought fake products.So I'm here to remind myself not to shop online on some not authenticated seller on a online shopping site!</h1>
        <p>After a while I'm still wondering if I got fakes or not,I'm pretty sure the Acqua gi gio was fake,because when I search the code on the back of the bottle and the back of the box,nothing show up!Same thing happen with the Dior Sauvage,but there was some idiot on YouTube showing his 5ml bottle,which looks exactly like my.</p>
        <p>For the others,I don't really know,probably are fakes as well,sadly.But there is an execption,the Bulgari Aqua Amara looks legit,in my opinion.And also the Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gio EDT.</p>
        <p>To be honest,I'm very sad because I paid a fair price for these products and they all look fake to me.Not sure about the vial ones since they could be legit,I don't know.</p>
        <p>I still have some thought that the Dior Sauvage EDT is legit,when I shake it,bubbles appears like the authentic one.Also the Versace,it don't look at cheap and pathetic as the fake 5ml Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gio Profumo</p>
        <p>Well I should have went ahead and buy an authentic 100ml bottle from a registered source,have their own website and I can get there by myself to buy it or having it shipped at my house.</p>
        <p>But instead I got caught up with the cheap,affordable price with mini bottles and vials that I received just now and the result was very disappointing</p>
        <p>I will never ever buy products online from some pretty not trustable sources.I will never make this mistake again,buying stuff on a random shop on a website that took more than a week to deliver my fucking chair.I regret buying those products so fucking much,I could have bought an authentic 100ml bottle but instead I didn't,I went out to buy mini bottles to try them out and the result was me sitting here,in my bathroom,typing about my feelings because I can't tell people what I did since I have make too much mistakes and harm people while doing so.It's really difficult for a guy like me and I also regret lying to my parents</p>
