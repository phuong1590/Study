<p>This paragraph contains some important text. All of this text is paragraph text, but <i>This is italicized text. On top of that,</i> this is not italicized. However, <u>This is underlined text.</u></p>

<p><u><i>This is underlined, and italicized.</i></u></p>	<!-- For styling two styles, you can place both the styles inside of each other, whichever style comes first does not make a difference, as long as it does not come outside of the text creation tag.-->
